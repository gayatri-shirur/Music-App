# Documentation Hub

This folder keeps the reference notes .

- [`api.md`](./api.md) – How we talk to the Audius API, required query parameters, and the response structure the app expects.
- [`hld.md`](./hld.md) – High-level design: the user journey, the major building blocks, and how the browser, React, and Audius interact.
- [`lld.md`](./lld.md) – Low-level design: component and hook responsibilities, state variables, props, and extension points.
- [`data-flow.md`](./data-flow.md) – Step-by-step data flow explained in prose, plus links to the accompanying diagrams.
- [`diagrams/`](./diagrams) – Mermaid-based visuals (user/data flow + component map) to help new developers grok the system at a glance.

Feel free to add more markdown files inside this folder if new features arrive. Keep the tone approachable so future contributors can ramp up quickly.
